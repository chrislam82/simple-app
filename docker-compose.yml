# Unlike docker run normally, docker-compose creates a default network that isn't the network with NAME="bridge"
# Specify own network name rather than use default "simple-app_default" used by docker-compose given name of cwd
# Can use external like volumes above to specify an external network
# its bridge by default. Just being verbose
# Issue: Not actually using in index.js at the moment since fetch() being called from Browser on host, not from the container hosting the frontend files. But the config still stands
